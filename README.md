# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

#use strapi.io [strapi.io]
Strapi is a headless CMS used to develop websites, mobile applications, eCommerce sites, and APIs. It allows you to create an API without knowing anything about the backend or databases.
Currently i am working on frontend so i use this cause of i haven't deep knowledge of backend . 
Make sure you check the current node version because strapi only available for node version 18 and 20.
For creating your local server using strapi its take atleast 6minutes so be patient don't panic.
